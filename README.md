![](https://github.com/najirh/netflix_sql_project/blob/main/logo.png)

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

## Schema

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(15),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(550)
);
```

## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Which maturity rating dominates Movies vs. TV Shows, 
### and who is Netflix's primary target audience?

WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS total_count
    FROM netflix
    WHERE rating IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        total_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY total_count DESC) AS ranking
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS dominant_rating,
    total_count
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE ranking = 1;

### 2.In which release years did Netflix produce/release the 
 ### highest proportion of its total Indian catalog?

SELECT 
    release_year,
    COUNT(show_id) AS total_release,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(show_id)::numeric / 
        (SELECT COUNT(show_id) FROM netflix WHERE country = 'India')::numeric * 100, 
        2
    ) AS pct_of_total_india_catalog
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY release_year
ORDER BY pct_of_total_india_catalog DESC
LIMIT 5;

### 3.Titles on Netflix belong to multiple genres stored in a 
### single text column (e.g., 'Comedies, Dramas'). How many total titles exist per individual genre?

SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ',')) AS genre,
    COUNT(show_id) AS total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 10;


### 4.How much of Netflix's catalog contains 
 ### sensitive/violent themes vs. family-friendly content based on plot descriptions?   

SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Sensitive / Mature'
        ELSE 'Family / General'
    END AS content_category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_titles,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix), 2) AS share_pct
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
